      <description>Update: I recommend reading Nvidia&amp;rsquo; GPU Server Application Deployment Made Easy for an alternative approach (Ansible) to setting up the NVDIA-Docker plugin.
There are many tutorials on how to leverage Amazon&amp;rsquo;s supreme computing power to perform deep learning tasks. I would like to take this opportunity to contribute to that collection.
I started working with Amazon&amp;rsquo;s EC2 instances for deep learning by reading some of these tutorials, including predominantly:
 Installing CUDA, OpenCL, and PyOpenCL on AWS EC2 Deep Learning Tutorial for Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s Facial Keypoints Detection Installing TensorFlow on AWS  I would launch an instance, install the necessary dependencies and create an AMI.</description>
